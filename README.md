# sALR All-Sky Light Pollution Model

A Python and ArcGIS-Pro implementation of the simplified All-Sky Light Pollution Ratio (sALR) model described in [Dan Duriscoe et al. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407317308749), "A simplified model of all-sky artificial sky glow derived from VIIRS Day/Night band data".

Input data for the model comes from the Colorado School of Mines [Earth Observation Group](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/vnl/), who produce annual composites of VIIRS Day-Night Band satellite imagery of nighttime lights.
